## Welcome to My Website! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maciej, an applied mathematician with a passion for solving practical problems using mathematical theories and concepts. Currently in my second year of doctoral school at the Pedagogical University of Cracow under the supervision of [Tomasz Szemberg](https://szemberg.up.krakow.pl). I am continuously expanding my knowledge in this field.

## Expertise and Experience ðŸ’¼

With professional experience in analyzing cryptocurrency models and improving their foundations in the field of decentralized finance, I have the ability to combine my theoretical knowledge with practical experience to effectively tackle real-world challenges.

My strong background in teaching and tutoring mathematics to students of various levels of comprehension has led to over 100 individuals successfully tutored by me. I use a variety of techniques and tools, such as interactive exercises, visual aids, and hands-on activities to assist students in learning and retaining new ideas and abilities.

As a versatile professional, I am able to tackle subjects like Algebra, Calculus, Discrete mathematics, and have experience with programming languages such as Rust, Python, Maple, and Excel (VBA), capable of implementing mathematical models on them.
Research Interests ðŸ“ˆ

My research interests include Decentralized Finance, Traditional Finance, and Algebraic Curves, Commutative Algebra, Combinatorics and Algebraic Geometry. I have published a few papers in the field and have been invited to participate in several talks and conferences.
