Iâ€™m Maciej, a 24-year-old applied mathematician with a passion for solving practical problems using mathematical theories and concepts. Currently in my second year of doctoral school at the Pedagogical University of Cracow under the supervision of [Tomasz Szemberg](https://szemberg.up.krakow.pl), I am continuously expanding my knowledge in this field.

## Expertise and Experience ðŸ’¼

With professional experience in analyzing cryptocurrency models and improving their foundations in the field of decentralized finance, I have the ability to combine my theoretical knowledge with practical experience to effectively tackle real-world challenges.

My strong background in teaching and tutoring mathematics to students of various levels of comprehension has led to over 100 individuals successfully tutored by me. I use a variety of techniques and tools, such as interactive exercises, visual aids, and hands-on activities to assist students in learning and retaining new ideas and abilities.

As a versatile professional, I am able to tackle subjects like Algebra, Calculus, Discrete mathematics, and have experience with programming languages such as Rust, Python, Maple, and Excel (VBA), capable of implementing mathematical models on them.

## Research Interests ðŸ“ˆ

My research interests include Decentralized Finance, Traditional Finance, and Algebraic Curves, Commutative Algebra, Combinatorics and Algebraic Geometry. I have published a few papers in the field and have been invited to participate in several talks and conferences.
